# Chat Using Socket Io # 

## Getting Started ## 
After cloning to your local machine, run the server with 'npm start' and open your browser on localhost:3000 

## Main Concepts Covered Here ##

 * [x] Utilising http with websockets (socket.io)
 * [x] Utilising express.static for serving static content 
 * [x] Utilising socket.io (server) - handling socket data, emit() vs broadcast() and on() (on server)
 * [x] Consuming socket.io (client) - utilising on() and emit() 

## Future Improvements ## 

 * [ ] Adding Websocket Authentication in a future example
 * [ ] Creating example for sending / receiving different object types 
 * [ ] Combining typeahead and rxjs (Angular)
